Observable class and @Injectable decorator

The Observable class is provided by the Reactive Extensions package, which is used by Angular to
handle state changes in applications. Observable object represents an asynchronous task that will produce a result at
some point in the future. Angular exposes its use of Observable objects for some features, including making
HTTP requests.

The @Injectable  decorator is used to tell Angular that this class will be used as a service, 
which allows other classes to access its functionality through a feature called dependency injection.
