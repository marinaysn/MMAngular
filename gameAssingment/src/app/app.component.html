1. Create three new components GameControl, Odd and Even - done
2. The GameControl conponent should have buttons to start and stop the game.  - done
3. When strting the game, an event (holding an incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval()) - done
4. The event should be listenable from outside the component - done
5. When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))  - done

6. A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen 
for the Even Components (on even numbers)
