Angular Notes:

--- Lesson 3-49: ---

Create a Model

create new file:
ex:
recipe.model.ts

 and inside write a blueprint of a model (variables, constructor and methods if any):
 ex:

 export class Recipe {

    public name: string;
    public description: string;
    public imagePath: string;

    constructor(name: string, desc: string, img: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = desc;
        this.imagePath = img;
    }
}


--- Lesson 3-50: ---
use Model from lesson 49 as this
ex:
 recipes: Recipe[] = [];

 and remember to import class model
