Angular Notes:

--- Lesson 3-49: ---

Create a Model

create new file:
ex:
recipe.model.ts

 and inside write a blueprint of a model (variables, constructor and methods if any):
 ex:

 export class Recipe {

    public name: string;
    public description: string;
    public imagePath: string;

    constructor(name: string, desc: string, img: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = desc;
        this.imagePath = img;
    }
}


--- Lesson 3-50: ---
use Model from lesson 49 as this
ex:
 recipes: Recipe[] = [];

 and remember to import class model


 --- Lesson 3-51: ---

 to loop through the list :
 use *ngFor to loop through the items
                <a href="#" 
                class="list-group-item clearfix" 
                *ngFor="let i of recipes">
                    <div class="pull-left">
                        <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"> {{ i.name }}</h4>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">{{i.description}}</p>
                    </div>
                    <span class="pull-right">
                        <img src="{{i.imagePath}}" alt="{{ i.name }}" class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 50px">
                    </span>
                </a>

 --- Lesson 3-54: ---

to create a Model with short convinient way
instead of creating public variable and then set them in constructor
use following method:
ex: Model Ingredient

export class Ingredient {
    constructor(public name: string, public amount: number){       
    }
}
